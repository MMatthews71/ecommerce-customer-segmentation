# Customer Segmentation Project

## Overview  
This project segments customers of an online retail business into distinct groups using clustering techniques. The goal is to identify meaningful customer segments based on purchasing behavior, enabling more targeted marketing strategies and improving customer retention.

## Dataset  
The dataset contains transaction-level data including invoice details, product descriptions, quantities, and customer IDs. It reflects actual sales data over a defined period, providing a rich source for analyzing customer purchase patterns.

## Methodology  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Feature engineering to create relevant customer metrics (e.g., revenue, purchase frequency)  
- K-Means clustering to identify customer segments  
- Cluster profiling and analysis to interpret segment characteristics  
- Visualization of clusters and key insights

## Results  
The project identified three main customer segments with distinct behaviors and revenue contributions:  
- **Core Regular Customers:** Moderate spenders with balanced purchasing habits  
- **VIP Premium Customers:** High-value customers with frequent and bulk purchases  
- **Entry-Level Customers:** One-time or minimal spenders  

These insights offer actionable recommendations for targeted marketing and customer retention strategies.

## Technologies Used  
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## How to Use  
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install required libraries (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)  
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to reproduce the analysis  
4. Explore and modify the code to adapt to your dataset
